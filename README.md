# CIFAR-10 Transfer Learning

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Transfer learning leverages a pre-trained model to improve performance on a new but related task. In this project, we'll use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and fine-tune it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

# Pre-trained Model

This project uses the pre-trained model VGG16 as a base.

# Results
Test Accuracy: 0.7498000264167786
